# Detection_Tracking_Objects
Object detection and tracking : Occluded/Not Occluded

The goal of this  project is to develop an algorithm for quality control using perception methods in an industrial environment. Quality control is performed using a fixed stereo camera overlooking a conveyor belt. 

Three different classes of objects are placed on the conveyor: boxes, books and cups. The algorithm must track and classify the objects on the conveyor belt, even when they move behind a fixed occlusion.
